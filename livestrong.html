        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Livestrong.com experienced explosive growth between 2015 and 2018. In that time, the content and product strategy struggled to keep up leading to disarray.
        </p>
        <p>
          At the start of 2019, the Livestrong.com team came to consensus on a strategy: focus and enhance. Phase 1 involved the focusing and consolidation of our content library to 4 categories: Get Fit, Eat Better, Manage Your Weight, and Live Well. Phase 2 involved us improving the content and user experiences of within these categories.
        </p>
        <p>
          This case study picks up at the beginning of 2020, when we began the enhancement phase of the Get Fit category - starting with workouts.

        <h2>Research</h2>
        <p>
           Activities included: stakeholder and user interviews, competitor usability and feature analysis, schema and model research, and a look into user search patterns.

                Our online competitors largely offered exercise instructions in the form of editorial: a visual asset (video, gif, or image) paired with a paragraph of explanation; while our native app competitors offered complete routines made up of individual exercises that leveraged structured data.

          I synthesized my findings into a Recommendations section of my write-up. You can read it in detail below, but the jist of it is: roughly model our content organization to the two schemas found on schema.org, create companion front-end and CMS-side modules, along with a recommendation that I'm not at liberty to share.

        <h2>Case Study Midpoint Recap</h2>
        <p>
          <strong>Problem: </strong>Livestrong.com needs an improved workout content experience that helps people of beginner-to-intermediate fitness levels learn about the right ways to perform and execute individual exercises and comprehensive routines.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Solution: </strong>Build a structured data driven experience. The project is phased and starts off with our in-article exercise experience.
        </p>
        <p>
          <strong>Important Note: </strong>From this point forward, the wires, research, and interations detailed below were developed in office, as well as, in class as part of my HCI studies. Parts of the work have made their way to production while other parts were created to serve as submissions for finals.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>Wires</h2>
      <p>
        The individual exercise module seen below houses:
        <ul>
          <li>
            exercise name
          </li>
          <li>
            visual asset (video or gif)
          </li>
          <li>
            information on sets, repetitions, rest period, or any applicable data
          </li>
          <li>
            supplementary instructions in an expandable container
          </li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      <img src="/images/Jose_Caldera_Livestrong_Wire_1.png" alt="The wireframes of in article exercise modules." />
      <p>
        The cumulative workout module seen below lives beneath the article's intro paragraph and houses rolled up data from all individual exercise modules on the page.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/Jose_Caldera_Livestrong_Wire_2.png" alt="The wireframes of in article exercise modules." />
      <p>
        We chose to explore and envision future phases of the project in which we'd attempt to differentiate our workout content from our standard editorial template.
      </p>
      <img src="/images/Jose_Caldera_Livestrong_Wire_3.png" alt="The wireframes of in article exercise modules." />

        The wires above and several others were taking into the first round of testing.
